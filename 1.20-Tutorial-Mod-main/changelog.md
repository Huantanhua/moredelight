<h3>Recipe Overload Update: Patch 2</h3>
<p><b>Summary:</b> This update introduces bread requirements for most sandwiches and allows bread slices/toast to be used with Some Assembly Required.</p>
<hr/>

<h3>üçû Bread Balancing:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>What:</b> Increased amount of bread slices when cutting bread from 2 slices to 4 slices, and removed the chance to get more bread slices when cutting bread.</li>
  <li><b>Why:</b> This change was made to make crafting sandwiches more affordable for players. By getting more slices from each loaf, players won't need to use as many resources to make their favorite sandwiches.</li>
</ul>

<h3>ü•™ Sandwiches:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>What:</b> Sandwiches, like the Bacon Sandwich, Steak with Egg Sandwich, and Tomato Sandwich, can now be made with either a whole bread, two bread slices, or two toasts. Sandwiches that require more bread, like the Egg Sandwich, can only be made with a whole bread.</li>
  <li><b>Why:</b> This change provides more flexibility when crafting simpler sandwiches while maintaining the recipe requirements for more complex ones.</li>
</ul>

<h3>üß© Compatibility:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Bread slices and toasts are now compatible with Some Assembly Required (thanks Digby for your suggestion!).</li>
</ul>
